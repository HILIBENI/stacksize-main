Git Repo for my modding adventures:

Changes a few thigs such as:
  -Changing the stack size of silver to 5000
  
  -Making the anima tree require more grass for higher levels, and less for the first few levels. This lowers the average grass required by about 3, but the added difficulty of having to get 30 grass should keep it balanced.

  -Setting the biosculpter speed to 300%
